# ðŸš— AGV Automama â€” Autonomous Campus Transport Vehicle

AGV Automama is a custom-built autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) developed to demonstrate **driverless passenger transport** within a university campus. Designed and fabricated from scratch, it integrates mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems into a unified platform for autonomous mobility in semi-structured environments. 
In this project the mechanical development phases of the project is breifly discussed. The base framework closely resembles the framework design of autorickshaws in our campus.
Even though autorickshaws are 3 wheeler , automama was made four wheeler.
